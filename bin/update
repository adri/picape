# Update Script

# This script is intended to help keep your local dependencies up to date after
# merging branches or pulling down new changes. This is particularly useful for
# front-end developers working on the app, who may not understand all the
# dependency management on the backend.

# Get any new Node.js dependencies

# Run any new database migrations
mix ecto.migrate
